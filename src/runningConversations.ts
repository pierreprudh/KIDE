// Which conversations have a live Harness Run right now.
//
// The rail lists threads you have walked away from, and walking away does not
// stop a run — the loop lives in Rust and keeps writing its transcript while
// the panel is unmounted. So a rail row needs to say "this one is still going"
// without the panel being there to say it.
//
// The obvious source is wrong on its own. AiPanel publishes `status: "running"`
// to the Mission Control store while it streams, but that publisher is
// mount-tied: leave mid-run and the last thing it wrote stays "running" in
// localStorage forever, even after the harness settles. So the store only
// *nominates* candidates — Rust is asked for the truth (`agent_run_status`),
// and each confirmed run is then followed on its global `agent-run:{id}`
// stream until it emits a terminal event. Confirmed runs are never polled;
// only the confirmation itself retries (see CONFIRM_RETRY_MS).
//
// One watcher set is shared by every subscriber: rows ask about their own id,
// not for the whole set, so a rail of forty conversations still runs one
// reconcile pass.

// never came back). A short bounded ladder covers the registration gap without
// turning the confirmation into an open-ended poll: a nomination that is still
// unconfirmed after the last rung really is stale (a panel unmounted mid-run,
// a Delegate PTY with no Harness Run) and stays off the rail.
