// Staging dropped/pasted files as turn attachments — the one place Klide
// decides what a photo or a document becomes on its way into a conversation.
//
// Two kinds land here, and they travel differently:
//
//  · a **photo** becomes a data-URI attachment the harness hands to a
//    vision-capable model, and the chat renders it as an image;
//  · a **document** becomes a text attachment — the same `{ path, content }`
//    shape an `@mention` produces — so it works on every model, blind or not.
//
// Anything else (a PDF, a zip, a binary) is refused by name rather than
// attached as garbage: Klide has no document wire yet, and folding raw bytes
// into the prompt would read as support that isn't there.
//
// Kept free of React, Tauri and the toast bus so both composers — the AI
// panel's and Focus's start stage — share one set of rules, and the rules
// stay testable.
