// Which model a live Conversation is on — and, more importantly, what is
// allowed to change it.
//
// The Conversation's `model` is metadata about a Run that already happened:
// the rail draws the maker's mark from it, Mission Control files the row under
// it, and cost is priced from it. So it must only ever move when a human picks
// a model, or when the Provider itself says the current pick does not exist.
// Two host-side echoes used to move it anyway:
//
//   * the `model` prop. It is App's idea of this panel's model, restored from
//     the persisted layout — it can be older than the session (a layout saved
//     before the Provider's model list corrected the pick). Adopting it
//     whenever it *differs* turns every unrelated App re-render into an edit.
//   * a failed model-list fetch. Falling back to this Provider's remembered
//     model treats a network error as a pick, and the remembered value can
//     belong to another Provider entirely.
//
// Both fired on one thread: it ran on `qwen3.8:27b-mlx` (the Rust run summary
// still says so) and was saved as `pierreprudh/lfm2.5-8b-a1b:latest`, so the
// history rail showed a LiquidAI mark for a Qwen conversation.

 * — the Provider is the authority on what it serves — but the replacement was

 * stars in insertion order. So the replacement was the user's OLDEST star for
 * that Provider, which for a long-lived favourites list is close to random: a
 * model starred once, months ago, outranked the one picked this morning. The
 * Provider's own remembered pick — the value the picker writes on every human
 * choice — was never consulted at all.

 * then its configured default, then the NEWEST star, then the list head. Only
